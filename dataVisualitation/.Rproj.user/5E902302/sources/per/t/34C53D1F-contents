# Data Visualization
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
View(mpg)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

# 1.Run ggplot(data = mpg). What do you see?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```
Nothing, just a gray square.

# 2.Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```

# 3.What happens if you make a scatterplot of class vs drv? Why is the plot not useful?
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(aes(x = class, y = drv))
```
Because, both variables are qualitative.
